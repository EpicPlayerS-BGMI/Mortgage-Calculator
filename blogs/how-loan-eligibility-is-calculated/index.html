        You've found your dream house, or perhaps you need funds for a business
        expansion. You walk into a bank (or visit their website), fill out an
        application, and wait anxiously. The biggest question on your mind is:
        <em>"How much money will they actually lend me?"</em>
      </p>

      <p
        class="text-lg mb-8 text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-400 leading-relaxed"
      >
        Loan eligibility isn't a guessing game. Whether you are in the USA, UK,
        or India, lenders use specific mathematical formulas to determine your
        repayment capacity. They want to ensure you can comfortably afford the
        monthly payments—often called <strong>EMIs</strong> (Equated Monthly
        Installments)—without going broke.
      </p>

        Understanding how this calculation works can help you improve your
        chances of approval and get the loan amount you need. Let’s break down
        the three pillars of loan eligibility:
        <strong>Income, Existing Debt, and Credit Score</strong>.

          The Golden Rule: The Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)
        </h2>

        <p class="mb-4 text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-400">
          Before looking at your income, banks look at your spending. The
          central concept of loan eligibility is the
          <strong>Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio</strong>. In India, this is often
          called the Fixed Obligation to Income Ratio (FOIR).

            What it means simply:
          </h3>
          <p class="text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300">
            Lenders believe you should not spend more than a certain percentage
            of your monthly income on debt repayments. The rest must be kept for
            living expenses (food, utilities, transport).
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="mb-4 text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-400">
          Generally, globally recognized lenders prefer that your total monthly
          loan payments (including the new loan you are applying for)
          <strong
            >should not exceed 40% to 50% of your net monthly income</strong

        </h2>

        <p class="mb-4 text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-400">
          The first number lenders look at is how much money you make. However,
          they don't look at your "Gross Salary" (the big number on your offer
          letter). They look at your <strong>Net Income</strong>—the money that
          actually hits your bank account after taxes and deductions.

          <li>
            <strong>For Salaried Employees:</strong> Lenders ask for salary
            slips and bank statements to verify stable, regular income deposits.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>For Self-Employed:</strong> Lenders review tax returns (ITR
            in India, 1040 in USA) over the last 2-3 years to determine average
            annual profit.

        <p class="mb-4 text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-400">
          This is where many applications face hurdles. Before giving you a new
          loan, the bank subtracts all your current monthly debt obligations
          from your income.

            >
            Choosing a longer repayment period (e.g., 30 years vs. 20 years for
            a mortgage) reduces your monthly EMI. This increases your immediate
            eligibility amount, although you pay more interest over time.

            A lower interest rate means a lower monthly EMI for the same loan

              The quickest ways are to pay off existing small debts to free up
              monthly income, improve your credit score to get a lower interest
              rate, or add a co-applicant (like a working spouse) to combine
              incomes.

              Having a high limit doesn't hurt, but having a high *outstanding
              balance* does. Banks consider the minimum monthly payment due on
              your credit cards as ongoing debt, which reduces your eligibility
              for a new loan.

              Online calculators often use gross income or ideal scenarios.
              Banks use actual net income, factor in all existing debts
              strictly, and may apply a higher interest rate based on your
              specific credit profile, resulting in a lower final offer.
